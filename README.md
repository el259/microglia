# Microglia ABM

## Overview of Purpose

This repo houses a project to present research in Microglial Activcation modeling in an easily accessible and presentable manner. This model parllels ODE work currently being worked on by the research group. Both of these projects are graciously and generously funded by NSF Award 2245839. 

The model is adapted from previous models implemented in [NetLogo](https://www.netlogoweb.org/web?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcjt101%2Fcsu-competition-2025-model%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fmicroglia-metabolism-model.nlogo) by the research group (associated with the same NSF Award, 2245839). 

## Usage

This repo currently contains a main Jupyter Notebook which can run the program, and visualize it inside the notebook using a Solara dashboard. The other directories contain files which receieve running edits and constant changes but these changes may be unstable. 

Please note that the program is currently being edited outside of the Jupyter Notebook and the notebook simply represents a usable functional build but may not represent the most recent or up-to-date work. The other directories within the repo will contain edits from members of the research group which implement new ideas and techniques that will apply research.
